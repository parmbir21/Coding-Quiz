# KNOWN ISSUE (WIP)
There is a known issue of being unable to properly created a list with the data pulled out of local storage. While showing the score and initial of one person is fine, adding more than one to that causes problems of leaving the values as undefined and not creating an extension to the list to increase the limit. This issue is being worked on and will update once that is fixed.
